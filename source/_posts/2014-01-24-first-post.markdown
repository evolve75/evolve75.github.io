The first post. What can I say? It makes the spaces fill up on an otherwise
content-deprived site.

Hopefully the first post will not remain lonely for long; other posts will soon
start populating this site, and the cacophony of the words will make this post
feel among friends&mdash;and change the loneliness of being alone, to the
loneliness of being alone in a crowd.
